<h3>
Reviews
</h3>

<p>
"Very rarely do cryptographers focus on the bigger picture of their
work: namely, how their systems and ciphers relate to the real world. In
this book, J.P. Aumasson describes an innovative, state-of-the art hash
function, while still making his work relatable to both the engineering
and mathematical sciences.
</p>

<p>
The approach taken to writing The Hash Function BLAKE is the approach
necessary to reverse the isolation of cryptography as a science, by
connecting it to programmers, engineers, and designers of both hardware
and software. By coupling this practical style with a thorough
mathematical description, this book is at the forefront of helping make
cryptography a field that is more relevant across the entire discipline
of computer science and engineering."

Back cover
</h3>

<p>
This is a comprehensive description of the cryptographic hash function
BLAKE, one of the five final contenders in the NIST SHA3 competition,
and of BLAKE2, an improved version popular among developers. It
describes how BLAKE was designed and why BLAKE2 was developed, and it
offers guidelines on implementing and using BLAKE, with a focus on
software implementation.  </p>
 

<p>
In the first two chapters, the authors offer a short introduction to
cryptographic hashing, the SHA3 competition, and BLAKE. They review
applications of cryptographic hashing, they describe some basic notions
such as security definitions and state-of-the-art collision search
methods, and they present SHA1, SHA2, and the SHA3 finalists. In the
chapters that follow, the authors give a complete description of the
four instances BLAKE-256, BLAKE-512, BLAKE-224, and BLAKE-384; they
describe applications of BLAKE, including simple hashing with or without
a salt, and HMAC and PBKDF2 constructions; they review implementation
techniques, from portable C and Python to AVR assembly and vectorized
code using SIMD CPU instructions; they describe BLAKE’s properties with
respect to hardware design for implementation in ASICs or FPGAs; they
explain BLAKE's design rationale in detail, from NIST’s requirements to
the choice of internal parameters; they summarize the known security
properties of BLAKE and describe the best attacks on reduced or modified
variants; and they present BLAKE2, the successor of BLAKE, starting with
motivations and also covering its performance and security aspects. The
book concludes with detailed test vectors, a reference portable C
implementation of BLAKE, and a list of third-party software
implementations of BLAKE and BLAKE2.
</p>

<p>
The book is oriented towards practice&mdash;engineering and craftsmanship&mdash;
rather than theory. It is suitable for developers, engineers, and
security professionals engaged with BLAKE and cryptographic hashing in
general, and for applied cryptography researchers and students who need
a consolidated reference and a detailed description of the design
process, or guidelines on how to design a cryptographic algorithm.  </p>
