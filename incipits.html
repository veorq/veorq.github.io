Dear friend now in the dusty clockless hours of the town when the streets lie
black and steaming in the wake of the watertrucks and now when the drunk and the
homeless have washed up in the lee of walls in alleys or abandoned lots and cats go forth
highshouldered and lean in the grim perimeters about, now in these sootblacked brick or
cobbled corridors where lightwire shadows make a gothic harp of cellar doors no soul
shall walk save you.

They came like a caravan of carnival folk up through the swales of
broomstraw and across the hill in the morning sun, the truck rocking and
pitching in the ruts and the musicians on chairs in the truckbed
teetering and tuning their instruments, the fat man with guitar grinning
and gesturing to others in a car behind and bending to give a note to
the fiddler who turned a fiddle peg and listened with a wrinkled face.
They passed under flowering apple trees and passed a log crib chinked
with orange mud and forded a branch and came in sight of an aged
clapboard house that stood in blue shade under the wall of the mountain.
Beyond it stood a barn. One of the men in the truck bonged on the cab
roof with his fist and the truck came to a halt. Cars and trucks came on
through the weeds in the yard, people afoot.

It had snowed lightly in the night and her frozen hair was gold and
crystalline and her eyes were frozen cold and hard as stones. One of her
yellow boots had fallen off and stood in the snow beneath her. The shape
of her coat lay dusted in the snow where she'd dropped it and she wore
only a white dress and she hung among the bare gray poles of the winter
trees with her head bowed and her hands turned slightly outward like
those of certain ocumenical statues whose attitude asks that their
history be considered. That the deep foundation of the world be
considered where it has its being in the sorrow of her creatures. The
hunter knelt and stogged his rifle upright in the snow beside him and
took off this gloves and let them fall and folded his hands one upon the
other. He thought that he should pray but he'd no prayer for such a
thing. He bowed his head. Tower of Ivory, he said. House of Gold. He
knelt there for a long time When he openied his eyes he saw a small
shape half buried in the snow and he leaned and dusted away the snow and
picked up a gold chain that held a steel key, a white gold ring. He
slipped them into the pocket of this hunting-coat. He'd heard the wind
in the night. The wind's work. A trashcan clattering over the bricks
behind his house. The snow blowing out there in the forest in the dark.
He looked up into those cold enameled eyes glinting blue in the weak
winter light. She had tier her dress with a red sash so that she'd be
found. Some bit of color in the scrupulous desolation. On this Christmas
day. This cold and barely spoken Christmas day.

I here present you, courteous reader, with the record of a remarkable period in my life: according to my application of it, I trust that it will prove not merely an interesting record, but in a considerable degree useful and instructive.  In that hope it is that I have drawn it up; and that must be my apology for breaking through that delicate and honourable reserve which, for the most part, restrains us from the public exposure of our own errors and infirmities.  Nothing, indeed, is more revolting to English feelings than the spectacle of a human being obtruding on our notice his moral ulcers or scars, and tearing away that “decent drapery” which time or indulgence to human frailty may have drawn over them; accordingly, the greater part of our confessions (that is, spontaneous and extra-judicial confessions) proceed from demireps, adventurers, or swindlers: and for any such acts of gratuitous self-humiliation from those who can be supposed in sympathy with the decent and self-respecting part of society, we must look to French literature, or to that part of the German which is tainted with the spurious and defective sensibility of the French.  All this I feel so forcibly, and so nervously am I alive to reproach of this tendency, that I have for many months hesitated about the propriety of allowing this or any part of my narrative to come before the public eye until after my death (when, for many reasons, the whole will be published); and it is not without an anxious review of the reasons for and against this step that I have at last concluded on taking it.

Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not
think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it
meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked
it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling
of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at
Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock
down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a
thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider
Kelly's star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box
like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five
or two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really
very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got
his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn's distaste for
boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and
it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read
too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his
class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was
middleweight boxing champion.

Nous voici encore seuls. Tout cela est si lent, si lourd, 
si triste... Bientôt je serai vieux. Et ce sera enfin fini. Il est

toussé : « Ne vous allongez pas surtout !... Restez assise 
dans votre lit ! » Je me méfiais. Et puis voilà... Et puis tant

Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them 
hitting. They were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the 
fence. Luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree. They took the
flag out, and they were hitting. Then they put the flag back and they
went to the table, and he hit and the other hit. Then they went on, and
I went along the fence. Luster came away from the flower tree and we
went along the fence and they stopped and we stopped and I looked
through the fence while Luster was hunting in the grass.

Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming
down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road
met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo....

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or
conversations?”

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh
dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch
out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large
rabbit-hole under the hedge.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of
the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly
calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come
to and wait for the turn of the tide.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an
interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded
together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of
the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red
clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A
haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.
The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed
condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest,
and the greatest, town on earth.

From a little after two oclock until almost sundown of the long still hot
weary dead September afternoon they sat in what Miss Coldfield still
called the office because her father had called it that—a dim hot
airless room with the blinds all closed and fastened for forty-three
summers because when she was a girl someone had believed that light and
moving air carried heat and that dark was always cooler, and which (as
the sun shone fuller and fuller on that side of the house) became
latticed with yellow slashes full of dust motes which Quentin thought of
as being flecks of the dead old dried paint itself blown inward from the
scaling blinds as wind might have blown them. There was a wistaria vine
blooming for the second time that summer on a wooden trellis before one
window, into which sparrows came now and then in random gusts, making a
dry vivid dusty sound before going away: and opposite Quentin, Miss
Coldfield in the eternal black which she had worn for forty-three years
now, whether for sister, father, or nothusband none knew, sitting so
bolt upright in the straight hard chair that was so tall for her that
her legs hung straight and rigid as if she had iron shinbones and
ankles, clear of the floor with that air of impotent and static rage
like children’s feet, and talking in that grim haggard amazed voice
until at last listening would renege and hearing-sense self-confound and
the long-dead object of her impotent yet indomitable frustration would
appear, as though by outraged recapitulation evoked, quiet inattentive
and harmless, out of the biding and dreamy and victorious dust.

Ça a débuté comme ça. Moi, j’avais jamais rien dit. Rien. C’est Arthur
Ganate qui m’a fait parler. Arthur, un étudiant, un carabin lui aussi,
un camarade. On se rencontre donc place Clichy.  C’était après le
déjeuner. Il veut me parler. Je l’écoute. « Restons pas dehors ! qu’il
me dit. Rentrons ! » Je rentre avec lui. Voilà. «Cette terrasse, qu’il
commence, c’est pour les œufs à la coque ! Viens par ici! » Alors, on
remarque encore qu’il n’y avait personne dans les rues, à cause de la
chaleur; pas de voitures, rien. Quand il fait très froid, non plus, il
n’y a personne dans les rues ; c’est lui, même que je m’en souviens,
qui m’avait dit à ce propos : «Les gens de Paris ont l’air toujours
d’être occupés, mais en fait, ils se promènent du matin au soir; la
preuve, c’est que lorsqu’il ne fait pas bon à se promener, trop froid
ou trop chaud, on ne les voit plus ; ils sont tous dedans à prendre des
cafés crème et des bocks. C’est ainsi! Siècle de vitesse ! qu’ils
disent. Où ça ? Grands changements ! qu’ils racontent. Comment ça? Rien
n’est changé en vérité. Ils continuent à s’admirer et c’est tout. Et ça
n’est pas nouveau non plus. Des mots, et encore pas beaucoup, même
parmi les mots, qui sont changés ! Deux ou trois par-ci, par-là, des
petits…» Bien fiers alors d’avoir fait sonner ces vérités utiles, on
est demeurés là assis, ravis, à regarder les dames du café.

C'était un hiver incertain. Les nuages passaient comme des draps essorés
sur l'anthracite du ciel, sur la harpe du ciel et s'arrachaient sur un
pommier, s'accrochaient et saignaient un peu sur la frise d'un pommier,
sur un encadrement de fenêtre trop haut placé, ou sur le nichoir, tiens
– le vieux nichoir en forme de papillote brûlée, qui pendait entre les
trognons et les mouches – les nuages passaient dans la réticule et
venaient échouer sur l'angle haut de la fenêtre de la cuisine, aux
persiennes de métal roussies : les nuages lait, amidon, plâtre, qui
passaient vite, comme des dépêches ou des débâcles. Le froid semblait
les sangler sous le ventre, à l'endroit où la buée empèse. Le fond de
l'air était d'une mobilité intrépide qui rendait les trémières fanées
bizarrement saillantes, menaçantes : glaives sans fleurs. Des ombres
lourdes, itinérantes, pleines d'air et d'eau, noires comme de la cendre
sèche, glissaient sur les murettes de béton encadrant le jardin
hivernal.

Ça a commencé à Coucy, Coucy-le-château-Auffrique. Dans l’Aisne, aux derniers
renseignements, en Picardie. Donc, ça a commencé là-bas, dans la beauté de son
écrin. Le ciel n’était pas roux, pas gris, pas noir, mais bleu, un grand bleu
de fiançailles. Dix-sept heures, poussivement, venaient au pas ; les guérets,
les bocages, la France qui était bien belle allait commencé la mastication du
soleil et de la lune, pointe de lumière écaillée, plus fine qu’un ongle,
attendait son tour dans un coin, esseulée. J’avais le regard qui partait vers
l’est, immobile que je me trouvais sur le chemin de ronde, un peu au-dessus du
clocher. Devant moi, le paysage ne bougeait pas du tout ; les champs, les bois,
les forêts, les près, les villages, les collines, les plateaux s’empilaient,
s’emboîtant et s’éloignant, et au loin, dans une douce pénombre, on devinait à
force d’yeux les champs de patates, de betteraves et de haricots.

Muchos años después, frente al pelotón de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de 
recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo. Macondo era entonces 
una aldea de veinte casas de barro y cañabrava construidas a la orilla de un río de aguas diáfanas 
que se precipitaban por un lecho de piedras pulidas, blancas y enormes como huevos 
prehistóricos. El mundo era tan reciente, que muchas cosas carecían de nombre, y para 
mencionarlas había que señalarías con el dedo. Todos los años, por el mes de marzo, una familia 
de gitanos desarrapados plantaba su carpa cerca de la aldea, y con un grande alboroto de pitos y 
timbales daban a conocer los nuevos inventos. Primero llevaron el imán. Un gitano corpulento, de 
barba montaraz y manos de gorrión, que se presentó con el nombre de Melquíades, hizo una 
truculenta demostración pública de lo que él mismo llamaba la octava maravilla de los sabios 
alquimistas de Macedonia. Fue de casa en casa arrastrando dos lingotes metálicos, y todo el 
mundo se espantó al ver que los calderos, las pailas, las tenazas y los anafes se caían de su sitio, 
y las maderas crujían por la desesperación de los clavos y los tornillos tratando de desenclavarse, 
y aun los objetos perdidos desde hacía mucho tiempo aparecían por donde más se les había 
buscado, y se arrastraban en desbandada turbulenta detrás de los fierros mágicos de Melquíades. 
«Las cosas, tienen vida propia -pregonaba el gitano con áspero acento-, todo es cuestión de 
despertarles el ánima.» José Arcadio Buendía, cuya desaforada imaginación iba siempre más lejos 
que el ingenio de la naturaleza, y aun más allá del milagro y la magia, pensó que era posible 
servirse de aquella invención inútil para desentrañar el oro de la tierra. Melquíades, que era un 
hombre honrado, le previno: «Para eso no sirve.» Pero José Arcadio Buendía no creía en aquel 
tiempo en la honradez de los gitanos, así que cambió su mulo y una partida de chivos por los dos 
lingotes imantados. Úrsula I guaran, su mujer, que contaba con aquellos animales para ensanchar 
el desmedrado patrimonio doméstico, no consiguió disuadirlo. «Muy pronto ha de sobrarnos oro 
para empedrar la casa», replicó su marido. Durante varios meses se empeñó en demostrar el 
acierto de sus conjeturas. Exploró palmo a palmo la región, inclusive el fondo del río, arrastrando 
los dos lingotes de hierro y recitando en voz alta el conjuro de Melquíades. Lo único que logró 
desenterrar fue una armadura del siglo xv con todas sus partes soldadas por un cascote de óxido, 
cuyo interior tenía la resonancia hueca de un enorme calabazo lleno de piedras. Cuando José 
Arcadio Buendía y los cuatro hombres de su expedición lograron desarticular la armadura, 
encontraron dentro un esqueleto calcificado que llevaba colgado en el cuello un relicario de cobre 
con un rizo de mujer.

A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly's supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D.H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress. Several of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be properly considered offenses against taste and decency. Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person's lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one's soul.

«J'ai juré de vous émouvoir, d'amitié ou de colère, qu'importe !» C'est
ainsi que je parlais jadis, au temps de <i>la Grande Peur</i>, il y a
sept longues années. À présent je ne me soucie plus beaucoup d'émouvoir,
du moins de colère. La colère des imbéciles m'a toujours rempli de
tristesse, mais aujourd'hui elle m'épouvanterait plutôt. Le monde entier
retentit de cette colère. Que voulez-vous ? Ils ne demandaient pas mieux
que de ne rien comprendre, et même ils se mettaient à plusieurs pour ça,
car la dernière chose dont l'homme soit capable est d'être bête ou
méchant tout seul, condition mystérieuse réservée sans doute au damné.
Ne comprenant rien ils se rassemblaient d'eux-mêmes, non pas selon leurs
affinités particulières, trop faibles, mais d'après la modeste fonction
qu'ils tenaient de la naissance ou du hasard et qui absorbait tout
entière leur petite vie. Car les classes moyennes sont presque seules à
fournir le véritable imbécile, la supérieure s'arrogeant le monopole
d'un genre de sottise parfaitement inutilisable, d'une sottise de luxe,
et l'inférieure ne réussissant que de grossières et parfois admirables
ébauches d'animalité.

I am a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last
thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what
would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as
yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:—I mean the
law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them,
professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers
histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental
souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners
for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the
strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might
write the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done. I
believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of
this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of
those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original
sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished
eyes saw of Bartleby, <i>that is</i> all I know of him, except, indeed, one
vague report which will appear in the sequel.

En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho
tiempo que vivía un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga
antigua, rocín flaco y galgo corredor. Una olla de algo más vaca que
carnero, salpicón las más noches, duelos y quebrantos los sábados,
lentejas los viernes, algún palomino de añadidura los domingos,
consumían las tres partes de su hacienda. El resto della concluían sayo
de velarte, calzas de velludo para las fiestas con sus pantuflos de lo
mismo, los días de entre semana se honraba con su vellori de lo más
fino. Tenía en su casa una ama que pasaba de los cuarenta, y una sobrina
que no llegaba a los veinte, y un mozo de campo y plaza, que así
ensillaba el rocín como tomaba la podadera. Frisaba la edad de nuestro
hidalgo con los cincuenta años, era de complexión recia, seco de carnes,
enjuto de rostro; gran madrugador y amigo de la caza. Quieren decir que
tenía el sobrenombre de Quijada o Quesada (que en esto hay alguna

When they came south of Grant County Boyd was not much more than a baby
and the newly formed county they'd named Hidalgo was itself little older
than the child. In the  country they'd quit lay the bones of a sister
and the bones of  his maternal grandmother. The new country was rich and
wild. You could ride clear to Mexico and not strike a crossfence. He
carried Boyd before him in the bow of the saddle and named to him
features of the landscape and birds and animals in both spanish and
english. In the new house they slept in the room off the kitchen and he
would lie awake at night and listen to his brother's breathing in the
dark and he would whisper half aloud to him as he slept his plans for
them and the life they should have.

On a winter's night in that first year he woke to hear wolves in the low
hills to the west oof the hoouse and he knew that they would be coming
out onto the plain in the snow to run the antelope in the moonlight. He
pulled his breeches off the footboard of the bed and got his shirt and
his blanketlined duckingcoat and got his boots from under the bed and
went out to the kitchen and dressed in the dark by the faint warmth of
the  stove and held the boots to the windowlight to pair them left and
right and pulled them on and rose and went to the kitchen door and
stepped out and closed the door behind him.

Two mountain chains traverse the republic roughly
from north to south, forming between them a number of
valleys and plateaus. Overlooking one of these valleys,
which is dominated by two volcanoes, lies, six thousand
feet above sea level, the town of Quauhnahuac. It is situated
well south of the Tropic of Cancer, to be exact on the
nineteenth parallel, in about the same latitude as the Revillagigedo
Islands to the west in the Pacific, or very much
further west, the southernmost tip of Hawaii—and as the
port of Tzucox to the east on the Atlantic seaboard of Yucatán
near the border of British Honduras, or very much
further east, the town of Juggernaut, in India, on the Bay of
Bengal.


<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The walls of the town, which is built on a hill, are
high, the streets and lanes tortuous and broken, the roads
winding. A fine American-style highway leads in from the
north but is lost in its narrow streets and comes out a goat
track. Quauhnahuac possesses eighteen churches and fiftyseven
cantinas. It also boasts a golf course and no less than
four hundred swimming pools, public and private, filled
with the water that ceaselessly pours down from the mountains,
and many splendid hotels.

In the time of Spanish rule, and for many years afterwards, the town of
Sulaco—the luxuriant beauty of the orange gardens bears witness to its
antiquity—had never been commercially anything more important than a coasting
port with a fairly large local trade in ox-hides and indigo. The clumsy
deep-sea galleons of the conquerors that, needing a brisk gale to move at all,
would lie becalmed, where your modern ship built on clipper lines forges ahead
by the mere flapping of her sails, had been barred out of Sulaco by the
prevailing calms of its vast gulf. Some harbours of the earth are made
difficult of access by the treachery of sunken rocks and the tempests of their
shores. Sulaco had found an inviolable sanctuary from the temptations of a
trading world in the solemn hush of the deep Golfo Placido as if within an
enormous semi-circular and unroofed temple open to the ocean, with its walls of
lofty mountains hung with the mourning draperies of cloud.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side of this broad curve in the straight
seaboard of the Republic of Costaguana, the last spur of the coast range forms
an insignificant cape whose name is Punta Mala. From the middle of the gulf the
point of the land itself is not visible at all; but the shoulder of a steep
hill at the back can be made out faintly like a shadow on the sky.

This book is about luck disguised and perceived as non-luck (that is,
skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as
non-randomness (that is, determinism). It manifests itself in the shape
of the <em>lucky fool</em>, defined as a person who benefited from a
disproportionate share of luck but attributes his success to some
other, generally very precise, reason. Such confusion crops up in the
most unexpected areas, even science, though not un such an accuentuated
and obvious manner as it does in the world of business. It is endemic
in politics, as it can be encountered in the shape of a country's
president discoursing on the jobs that "he" created, "his" recovery,
and "his predecessor's" inflation.

To get there you follow Highway 58, going northeast out of the city, and
it is a good highway and new. Or was new, that day we went up it. You
look up the highway and it is straight for miles, coming at you, with
the black line down the center coming at and at you, black and slick and
tarry-shining against the white of the slab, and the heat dazzles up
from the white slab so that only the black line is clear, coming at you
with the whine of the tires, and if you don't quit staring at that line
and don't take a few deep breaths and slap yourself hard on the back of
the neck you'll hypnotize yourself and you'll come to just at the moment
when the right fron wheel hooks over into the black dirt shoulder off
the slab, and you'll try to jerk her back on but you can't because the
slab is high like a curb, and maybe you'll try to reach to turn off the
ignition just as the starts the dive. But you won't make it, of course.
Then a nigger chopping cotton a mile away, he'll look up and see the
little column of black smoke standing up above the vitriolic, arsenical
green of the cotton rows, and up against the violent, metallic,
throbbing blue of the sky, and he'll say, "Lawd God, hit's a-nudder one
done done hit!" And the next nigger down the next row, he'll say, "Lawd
God," and the first nigger will giggle, and the hoe will lift again and
the blade will flash in the sun like a heliograph. Then a few days later
the boys from the Highway Department will mark the spot with a little
metal square on a metal rod stuck in the black dirt off the shoulder,
the metal square painted white and on it in black a skull and
crossbones. Later on love vine will climb up it, out of the weeds.

Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the
reason for its own existence. If superior creatures from space ever
visit earth, the first question they will ask, in order to assess the
level of our civilization, is: 'Have they discovered evolution yet?'
Living organisms had existed on earth, without ever knowing why, for
over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one
of them. His name was Charles Darwin. To be fair, others had had
inklings of the truth, but it was Darwin who first put together a
coherent and tenable account of why we exist. Darwin made it possible
for us to give a sensible answer to the curious child whose question
heads this chapter. We no longer have to resort to superstition when
faced with the deep problems: Is there a meaning to life? What are we
for? What is man? After posing the last of these questions, the eminent
zoologist G. G. Simpson put it thus: 'The point I want to make now is
that all attempts to answer that question before 1859 are worthless and
that we will be better off if we ignore them completely.'

<br /><br />

<p> 
We were wanderers from the beginning. We knew every stand of tree for
a hundred miles.  When the fruits or nuts were ripe, we were there. We
followed the herds in their annual migrations. We rejoiced in fresh
meat. through stealth, feint, ambush, and main-force assault, a few of
us cooperating accomplished what many of us, each hunting alone, could
not. We depended on one another. Making it on our own was as ludicrous
to imagine as was settling down.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working together, we protected our children
from the lions and the hyenas. We taught them the skills they would
need. And the tools. Then, as now, technology was the key to our
survival.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the drought was prolonged, or when an
unsettling chill lingered in the summer air, our group moved
on&mdash;sometimes to unknown lands. We sought a better place. And
when we couldn't get on with the others in our little nomadic band, we
left to find a more friendly bunch somewhere else. We could always
begin again.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 99.9 percent of the time since our species
came to be, we were hunters and foragers, wanderers on the savannahs
and the steppes.  There were no border guards then, no customs
officials. The frontier was everywhere. We were bounded only by the
Earth and the ocean and the sky&mdash;plus occasional grumpy
neighbors.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the climate was congenial, though, when
the food was plentiful, we were willing to stay
put. Unadventurous. Overweight. Careless. In the last ten thousand
years&mdash;an instant in our long history&mdash;we've abandoned the
nomadic life. We've domesticated the plants and animals. Why chase the
food when you can make it come to you?

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all its material advantages, the sedentary
life has left us edgy, unfulfilled. Even after 400 generations in
villages and cities, we haven't forgotten. The open road still softly
calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood. We invest far-off
places with a certain romance. This appeal, I suspect, has been
meticulously crafted by natural selection as an essential element in
our survival. Long summers, mild winters, rich harvests, plentiful
game&mdash;none of them lasts forever. It is beyond our powers to
predict the future. Catastrophic events have a way of sneaking up on
us, of catching us unaware. Your own life, or your band's, or even
your species' might be owed to a restless few&mdash;drawn, by a
craving they can hardly articulate or understand, to undiscovered
lands and new worlds.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long
precisely&mdash;having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I
find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of
every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
methodically knocking people's hats off&mdash;then, I account it high
time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for
pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself
upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing
surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their
degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
towards the ocean with me.

dark glass where the lilies leaned so palely from their waisted
cutglass vase. Along the cold hallway behind him hung the portraits of
forebears only dimly known to him all framed in glass and dimly lit
above the narrow wainscotting. He looked down at the guttered

execution. I didnt have to go but I did. I sure didnt wanted to. He'd
killed a fourteen year old girl and I can tell you right now I never
did have no great desire to visit with him let alone go to his
execution but I done it. The papers said it was a crime of passion and
he told me there wasnt no passion to it. He'd been datin this girl,
young as whe was. he was nineteen. And he told me that he had been
plannin to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said
that if they turned hum out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was goin
to hell. Told it to me out of his own mouth. I dont know what to make
of that. I surely dont. I thought I'd never seen a person like that
and it got me to wonderin if maybe he was some new kind. I watched
them strap him into the seat and shut the door. He might of looked a
bit nervous about it but that was about all. I really believe that he
knew he was goin to be in hell in fifteen minutes. I believe
that. Called me Sheriff. But I didnt know what to say to him. What do
you say to a man that by his own admission has no soul? Why would you
say anything? I've thought about it a good deal. But he wasnt nothin

brought me to a place in my life I would not of thought I'd of come
to. Somewhere out there is a true and living prophet of destruction
and I dont want to confront him. I know he's real. I have seen his
work. I walked in front of those eyes once. I wont to it again. I wont
push my chips forward and stand up and go out to meet him. It aint
