C'était un hiver incertain. Les nuages passaient comme des draps essorés
sur l'anthracite du ciel, sur la harpe du ciel et s'arrachaient sur un
pommier, s'accrochaient et saignaient un peu sur la frise d'un pommier,
sur un encadrement de fenêtre trop haut placé, ou sur le nichoir, tiens
– le vieux nichoir en forme de papillote brûlée, qui pendait entre les
trognons et les mouches – les nuages passaient dans la réticule et
venaient échouer sur l'angle haut de la fenêtre de la cuisine, aux
persiennes de métal roussies : les nuages lait, amidon, plâtre, qui
passaient vite, comme des dépêches ou des débâcles. Le froid semblait
les sangler sous le ventre, à l'endroit où la buée empèse. Le fond de
l'air était d'une mobilité intrépide qui rendait les trémières fanées
bizarrement saillantes, menaçantes : glaives sans fleurs. Des ombres
lourdes, itinérantes, pleines d'air et d'eau, noires comme de la cendre
sèche, glissaient sur les murettes de béton encadrant le jardin
hivernal.

Ça a commencé à Coucy, Coucy-le-château-Auffrique. Dans l’Aisne, aux derniers
renseignements, en Picardie. Donc, ça a commencé là-bas, dans la beauté de son
écrin. Le ciel n’était pas roux, pas gris, pas noir, mais bleu, un grand bleu
de fiançailles. Dix-sept heures, poussivement, venaient au pas ; les guérets,
les bocages, la France qui était bien belle allait commencé la mastication du
soleil et de la lune, pointe de lumière écaillée, plus fine qu’un ongle,
attendait son tour dans un coin, esseulée. J’avais le regard qui partait vers
l’est, immobile que je me trouvais sur le chemin de ronde, un peu au-dessus du
clocher. Devant moi, le paysage ne bougeait pas du tout ; les champs, les bois,
les forêts, les près, les villages, les collines, les plateaux s’empilaient,
s’emboîtant et s’éloignant, et au loin, dans une douce pénombre, on devinait à
force d’yeux les champs de patates, de betteraves et de haricots.

<p style="width:50%">
Muchos años después, frente al pelotón de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de 
recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo. Macondo era entonces 
una aldea de veinte casas de barro y cañabrava construidas a la orilla de un río de aguas diáfanas 
que se precipitaban por un lecho de piedras pulidas, blancas y enormes como huevos 
prehistóricos. El mundo era tan reciente, que muchas cosas carecían de nombre, y para 
mencionarlas había que señalarías con el dedo. Todos los años, por el mes de marzo, una familia 
de gitanos desarrapados plantaba su carpa cerca de la aldea, y con un grande alboroto de pitos y 
timbales daban a conocer los nuevos inventos. Primero llevaron el imán. Un gitano corpulento, de 
barba montaraz y manos de gorrión, que se presentó con el nombre de Melquíades, hizo una 
truculenta demostración pública de lo que él mismo llamaba la octava maravilla de los sabios 
alquimistas de Macedonia. Fue de casa en casa arrastrando dos lingotes metálicos, y todo el 
mundo se espantó al ver que los calderos, las pailas, las tenazas y los anafes se caían de su sitio, 
y las maderas crujían por la desesperación de los clavos y los tornillos tratando de desenclavarse, 
y aun los objetos perdidos desde hacía mucho tiempo aparecían por donde más se les había 
buscado, y se arrastraban en desbandada turbulenta detrás de los fierros mágicos de Melquíades. 
«Las cosas, tienen vida propia -pregonaba el gitano con áspero acento-, todo es cuestión de 
despertarles el ánima.» José Arcadio Buendía, cuya desaforada imaginación iba siempre más lejos 
que el ingenio de la naturaleza, y aun más allá del milagro y la magia, pensó que era posible 
servirse de aquella invención inútil para desentrañar el oro de la tierra. Melquíades, que era un 
hombre honrado, le previno: «Para eso no sirve.» Pero José Arcadio Buendía no creía en aquel 
tiempo en la honradez de los gitanos, así que cambió su mulo y una partida de chivos por los dos 
lingotes imantados. Úrsula I guaran, su mujer, que contaba con aquellos animales para ensanchar 
el desmedrado patrimonio doméstico, no consiguió disuadirlo. «Muy pronto ha de sobrarnos oro 
para empedrar la casa», replicó su marido. Durante varios meses se empeñó en demostrar el 
acierto de sus conjeturas. Exploró palmo a palmo la región, inclusive el fondo del río, arrastrando 
los dos lingotes de hierro y recitando en voz alta el conjuro de Melquíades. Lo único que logró 
desenterrar fue una armadura del siglo xv con todas sus partes soldadas por un cascote de óxido, 
cuyo interior tenía la resonancia hueca de un enorme calabazo lleno de piedras. Cuando José 
Arcadio Buendía y los cuatro hombres de su expedición lograron desarticular la armadura, 
encontraron dentro un esqueleto calcificado que llevaba colgado en el cuello un relicario de cobre 
con un rizo de mujer.

A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly's supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D.H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress. Several of the outfits, Ignatius noticed, were new enough and expensive enough to be properly considered offenses against taste and decency. Possession of anything new or expensive only reflected a person's lack of theology and geometry; it could even cast doubts upon one's soul.

«J'ai juré de vous émouvoir, d'amitié ou de colère, qu'importe !» C'est
ainsi que je parlais jadis, au temps de <i>la Grande Peur</i>, il y a
sept longues années. À présent je ne me soucie plus beaucoup d'émouvoir,
du moins de colère. La colère des imbéciles m'a toujours rempli de
tristesse, mais aujourd'hui elle m'épouvanterait plutôt. Le monde entier
retentit de cette colère. Que voulez-vous ? Ils ne demandaient pas mieux
que de ne rien comprendre, et même ils se mettaient à plusieurs pour ça,
car la dernière chose dont l'homme soit capable est d'être bête ou
méchant tout seul, condition mystérieuse réservée sans doute au damné.
Ne comprenant rien ils se rassemblaient d'eux-mêmes, non pas selon leurs
affinités particulières, trop faibles, mais d'après la modeste fonction
qu'ils tenaient de la naissance ou du hasard et qui absorbait tout
entière leur petite vie. Car les classes moyennes sont presque seules à
fournir le véritable imbécile, la supérieure s'arrogeant le monopole
d'un genre de sottise parfaitement inutilisable, d'une sottise de luxe,
et l'inférieure ne réussissant que de grossières et parfois admirables
ébauches d'animalité.

<i>Bartleby, the Scrivener</i>, Herman Melville

<p style="width:50%">

I am a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last
thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what
would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as
yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:—I mean the
law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them,
professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers
histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental
souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners
for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the
strangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might
write the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done. I
believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of
this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of
those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original
sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own astonished
eyes saw of Bartleby, <i>that is</i> all I know of him, except, indeed, one
vague report which will appear in the sequel.

En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho

carnero, salpicón las más noches, duelos y quebrantos los sábados,
lentejas los viernes, algún palomino de añadidura los domingos,
consumían las tres partes de su hacienda. El resto della concluían sayo
de velarte, calzas de velludo para las fiestas con sus pantuflos de lo
mismo, los días de entre semana se honraba con su vellori de lo más
fino. Tenía en su casa una ama que pasaba de los cuarenta, y una sobrina
que no llegaba a los veinte, y un mozo de campo y plaza, que así
ensillaba el rocín como tomaba la podadera. Frisaba la edad de nuestro
hidalgo con los cincuenta años, era de complexión recia, seco de carnes,
enjuto de rostro; gran madrugador y amigo de la caza. Quieren decir que

When they came south of Grant County Boyd was not much more than a baby
and the newly formed county they'd named Hidalgo was itself little older
than the child. In the  country they'd quit lay the bones of a sister
and the bones of  his maternal grandmother. The new country was rich and
wild. You could ride clear to Mexico and not strike a crossfence. He
carried Boyd before him in the bow of the saddle and named to him
features of the landscape and birds and animals in both spanish and
english. In the new house they slept in the room off the kitchen and he
would lie awake at night and listen to his brother's breathing in the
dark and he would whisper half aloud to him as he slept his plans for
them and the life they should have.

On a winter's night in that first year he woke to hear wolves in the low

pulled his breeches off the footboard of the bed and got his shirt and
his blanketlined duckingcoat and got his boots from under the bed and
went out to the kitchen and dressed in the dark by the faint warmth of
the  stove and held the boots to the windowlight to pair them left and

<i>Under the Volcano</i>, Malcolm Lowry

<p style="width:50%">


Two mountain chains traverse the republic roughly
from north to south, forming between them a number of
valleys and plateaus. Overlooking one of these valleys,
which is dominated by two volcanoes, lies, six thousand
feet above sea level, the town of Quauhnahuac. It is situated
well south of the Tropic of Cancer, to be exact on the
nineteenth parallel, in about the same latitude as the Revillagigedo
Islands to the west in the Pacific, or very much
further west, the southernmost tip of Hawaii—and as the
port of Tzucox to the east on the Atlantic seaboard of Yucatán
near the border of British Honduras, or very much
further east, the town of Juggernaut, in India, on the Bay of
Bengal.


<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The walls of the town, which is built on a hill, are
high, the streets and lanes tortuous and broken, the roads
winding. A fine American-style highway leads in from the
north but is lost in its narrow streets and comes out a goat
track. Quauhnahuac possesses eighteen churches and fiftyseven
cantinas. It also boasts a golf course and no less than
four hundred swimming pools, public and private, filled
with the water that ceaselessly pours down from the mountains,
and many splendid hotels.

In the time of Spanish rule, and for many years afterwards, the town of
Sulaco—the luxuriant beauty of the orange gardens bears witness to its
antiquity—had never been commercially anything more important than a coasting
port with a fairly large local trade in ox-hides and indigo. The clumsy
deep-sea galleons of the conquerors that, needing a brisk gale to move at all,
would lie becalmed, where your modern ship built on clipper lines forges ahead
by the mere flapping of her sails, had been barred out of Sulaco by the
prevailing calms of its vast gulf. Some harbours of the earth are made
difficult of access by the treachery of sunken rocks and the tempests of their
shores. Sulaco had found an inviolable sanctuary from the temptations of a
trading world in the solemn hush of the deep Golfo Placido as if within an
enormous semi-circular and unroofed temple open to the ocean, with its walls of
lofty mountains hung with the mourning draperies of cloud.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side of this broad curve in the straight
seaboard of the Republic of Costaguana, the last spur of the coast range forms
an insignificant cape whose name is Punta Mala. From the middle of the gulf the
point of the land itself is not visible at all; but the shoulder of a steep
hill at the back can be made out faintly like a shadow on the sky.

<i>Fooled by Randomness</i>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb

<p style="width:50%">

This book is about luck disguised and perceived as non-luck (that is,
skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as
non-randomness (that is, determinism). It manifests itself in the shape
of the <em>lucky fool</em>, defined as a person who benefited from a
disproportionate share of luck but attributes his success to some
other, generally very precise, reason. Such confusion crops up in the
most unexpected areas, even science, though not un such an accuentuated
and obvious manner as it does in the world of business. It is endemic
in politics, as it can be encountered in the shape of a country's
president discoursing on the jobs that "he" created, "his" recovery,
and "his predecessor's" inflation.

To get there you follow Highway 58, going northeast out of the city, and
it is a good highway and new. Or was new, that day we went up it. You
look up the highway and it is straight for miles, coming at you, with
the black line down the center coming at and at you, black and slick and
tarry-shining against the white of the slab, and the heat dazzles up
from the white slab so that only the black line is clear, coming at you
with the whine of the tires, and if you don't quit staring at that line
and don't take a few deep breaths and slap yourself hard on the back of
the neck you'll hypnotize yourself and you'll come to just at the moment
when the right fron wheel hooks over into the black dirt shoulder off
the slab, and you'll try to jerk her back on but you can't because the
slab is high like a curb, and maybe you'll try to reach to turn off the
ignition just as the starts the dive. But you won't make it, of course.
Then a nigger chopping cotton a mile away, he'll look up and see the
little column of black smoke standing up above the vitriolic, arsenical
green of the cotton rows, and up against the violent, metallic,
throbbing blue of the sky, and he'll say, "Lawd God, hit's a-nudder one
done done hit!" And the next nigger down the next row, he'll say, "Lawd
God," and the first nigger will giggle, and the hoe will lift again and
the blade will flash in the sun like a heliograph. Then a few days later
the boys from the Highway Department will mark the spot with a little
metal square on a metal rod stuck in the black dirt off the shoulder,
the metal square painted white and on it in black a skull and
crossbones. Later on love vine will climb up it, out of the weeds.

<i>The Selfish Gene</i>, Richard Dawkins

<p style="width:50%">

Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the
reason for its own existence. If superior creatures from space ever
visit earth, the first question they will ask, in order to assess the
level of our civilization, is: 'Have they discovered evolution yet?'
Living organisms had existed on earth, without ever knowing why, for
over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one
of them. His name was Charles Darwin. To be fair, others had had
inklings of the truth, but it was Darwin who first put together a
coherent and tenable account of why we exist. Darwin made it possible
for us to give a sensible answer to the curious child whose question
heads this chapter. We no longer have to resort to superstition when
faced with the deep problems: Is there a meaning to life? What are we
for? What is man? After posing the last of these questions, the eminent
zoologist G. G. Simpson put it thus: 'The point I want to make now is
that all attempts to answer that question before 1859 are worthless and
that we will be better off if we ignore them completely.'

<p style="width:50%">
We were wanderers from the beginning. We knew every stand of tree for
a hundred miles.  When the fruits or nuts were ripe, we were there. We
followed the herds in their annual migrations. We rejoiced in fresh
meat. through stealth, feint, ambush, and main-force assault, a few of
us cooperating accomplished what many of us, each hunting alone, could
not. We depended on one another. Making it on our own was as ludicrous
to imagine as was settling down.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working together, we protected our children
from the lions and the hyenas. We taught them the skills they would
need. And the tools. Then, as now, technology was the key to our
survival.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the drought was prolonged, or when an
unsettling chill lingered in the summer air, our group moved
on&mdash;sometimes to unknown lands. We sought a better place. And
when we couldn't get on with the others in our little nomadic band, we
left to find a more friendly bunch somewhere else. We could always
begin again.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 99.9 percent of the time since our species
came to be, we were hunters and foragers, wanderers on the savannahs
and the steppes.  There were no border guards then, no customs
officials. The frontier was everywhere. We were bounded only by the
Earth and the ocean and the sky&mdash;plus occasional grumpy
neighbors.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the climate was congenial, though, when
the food was plentiful, we were willing to stay
put. Unadventurous. Overweight. Careless. In the last ten thousand
years&mdash;an instant in our long history&mdash;we've abandoned the
nomadic life. We've domesticated the plants and animals. Why chase the
food when you can make it come to you?

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all its material advantages, the sedentary
life has left us edgy, unfulfilled. Even after 400 generations in
villages and cities, we haven't forgotten. The open road still softly
calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood. We invest far-off
places with a certain romance. This appeal, I suspect, has been
meticulously crafted by natural selection as an essential element in
our survival. Long summers, mild winters, rich harvests, plentiful
game&mdash;none of them lasts forever. It is beyond our powers to
predict the future. Catastrophic events have a way of sneaking up on
us, of catching us unaware. Your own life, or your band's, or even
your species' might be owed to a restless few&mdash;drawn, by a
craving they can hardly articulate or understand, to undiscovered
lands and new worlds.

    Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long

    particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a
    little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of
    driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I
    find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,
    drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
    pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of
    every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
    upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
    prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
    methodically knocking people's hats off&mdash;then, I account it high
    time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for
    pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself
    upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing

See the child. He is pale and thin, he wears a thin and ragged linen
shirt. He stokes the scullery fire. Outside lie dark turned fields
with rags of snow and darker woods beyond that harbor yet a few last
wolves. His folk are known for hewers of wood and drawers of water but
in truth his father has been a schoolmaster. He lies in drink, he
quotes from poets whose names are now lost. The boy crouches by the
fire and watches him.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night of your birth. Thirty-three. The Leonids
they were called. God how the stars did fall. I looked for blackness,
holes in the heavens. The Dipper stove.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother dead these fourteen years did
incubate in her own bosom the creature who would carry her off. The
father never speaks her name, the child does not know it. He has a
sister in this world that he will not see again. He watches, pale and
unwashed.  He can neither read nor write and in him broods already a
taste for mindless violence.  All history present in that visage, the
child the father of the man.

The candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the
pierglass twister and righted when he entered the hall and again when
he shut the door. He took off his hat and came slowly forward. The
floorboard creaked under his boots. In his black suit he stood in the
dark glass where the lilies leaned so palely from their waisted
cutglass vase. Along the cold hallway behind him hung the portraits of
forebears only dimly known to him all framed in glass and dimly lit
above the narrow wainscotting. He looked down at the guttered
candlestub. He pressed his thumbprint in the warm wax pooled on the
oak veneer. Lastly he looked at the face so caved and drawn among the
folds of funeral cloth, the yellowed moustache, the eyelids paper
thin. That was not sleeping. That was not sleeping.

I sent one boy to the gaschamber at Huntsville. One and only one. My
arrest and my testimony. I went up there and visited with him two or
three times. Three times. The last time was the day of his
execution. I didnt have to go but I did. I sure didnt wanted to. He'd
killed a fourteen year old girl and I can tell you right now I never
did have no great desire to visit with him let alone go to his
execution but I done it. The papers said it was a crime of passion and
he told me there wasnt no passion to it. He'd been datin this girl,
young as whe was. he was nineteen. And he told me that he had been
plannin to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said
that if they turned hum out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was goin
to hell. Told it to me out of his own mouth. I dont know what to make
of that. I surely dont. I thought I'd never seen a person like that
and it got me to wonderin if maybe he was some new kind. I watched
them strap him into the seat and shut the door. He might of looked a
bit nervous about it but that was about all. I really believe that he
knew he was goin to be in hell in fifteen minutes. I believe
that. Called me Sheriff. But I didnt know what to say to him. What do
you say to a man that by his own admission has no soul? Why would you
say anything? I've thought about it a good deal. But he wasnt nothin
compared to what was comin down the pike. 

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say the eyes are the windows to the
soul. I dont know what them eyes was the windows to and I guess I'd as
soon not know. But there is another view of the world out there and
other eyes to see it and that's where this is goin. It has done
brought me to a place in my life I would not of thought I'd of come
to. Somewhere out there is a true and living prophet of destruction
and I dont want to confront him. I know he's real. I have seen his
work. I walked in front of those eyes once. I wont to it again. I wont
push my chips forward and stand up and go out to meet him. It aint
just bein older. I wish that it was. I cant say that it's even what
you are willin to do. Because I always knew that you had to be willin
to die to even do this job. That was always true. Not to sound
glorious about it or nothin but you do. If you aint they'll know
it. They'll see it in your heartbeat. I think it is more like what you
are willin to become. And I think a man would have to put his soul at
hazard. And I wont do that. I think now that maybe I never would.

Suddenly: The milk truck cut a sharp right turn and grazed the
curb. The driver lost the wheel. He panic-popped the brakes. He
induced a rear-end skid. A Wells Fargo armored car clipped the milk
truck side/head-on.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark it now:

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7:16 a.m. South L.A., 84th and
Budlong. Residential darktown. Shit shacks with dirt front yards.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jolt stalled out both vehicles. The milk
truck driver hit the dash. The driver's side door blew wide. The
driver keeled and hit the sidewalk. He was fortyish male Negro.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armored car notched some hood dents. Three
guards got out and scoped the damage. They were white men in tight
khakis. They wore Sam Browne belts with buttoned pistol flaps.

<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They knelt beside the milk truck driver. The guy twitched and
gasped. The dashboard bound gouged hist forehead. Blood dripped into
his eyes.
